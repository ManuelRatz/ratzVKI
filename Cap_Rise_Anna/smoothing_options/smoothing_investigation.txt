Smoothing the height:
Large values of s lead to a flattening of the height curve at the beginning
Large values of s lead to a bigger initial height
This does however not effect the global scope, there the courses are roughly the same

Small values of s dont smooth the gradient of the velocity, but a difference in the initial conditions can clearly be seen. Larger values also lead to smoother gradients
Large values of s smooth out some bumps in the later course but not perfectly either, small values have little to no impact

Smoothing the gradient is a very good tool to eliminate spikes
There is no notable difference between smoothing the raw data of h or the smoothed data of h so it is probably best to just smooth the raw data to not have too many parameters

Smoothing the contact angle
High values of s (200) result in lower peaks but also in the filtering of the high frequency noise (e.g. at 2.25 s)

weighting does not work for some reason (to smooth out the peak at 2.8 s for example)
