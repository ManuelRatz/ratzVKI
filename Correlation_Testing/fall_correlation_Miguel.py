@description: Test Case for the DESCENDING interface to check the possiblity
    of a correlation from the acceleration and the velocity (both dimensionless)
    One test case is loaded and smoothed, then two fittings are being done:
        One using complex numbers and casting it to the real value
        One using the absolute value and the sign separately
    This is required because we are raising negaitve numbers to a fraction power

Now the thing that I have found to be problematic:
    
For a given test case, say 'C', I can run the code and I get a set of fitting points.
If I now change the cut_ending parameter, the smoothing plots for Theta and Ca
only change by a small amount. However, the correlation parameters change by
quite a bit. I used a cut_ending of 20 and 10 to show this. The only way to
improve this in my opinion is to have a more stable fit, that requires less filtering
and can be trusted more. 

Running test case 'B' again gives completely different fitting parameters, here 
you can change cut_ending again to see how it affects the parameters.

Keep in mind that these are the fast releases, the best ones, by a lot. For the
slow and medium releases the results are much much worse, the fitting often even 
fails. 

Now that I am writing this, I have thought to put one additional case, a slow release
for water, case A. The velocity and acceleration are absolutely weird and strange.
My biggest problem is that I was not present for the experiments, so I don't know
how they were conducted and cannot judge if this is plausible'

I have not tried to look at a Rise so far, because the slow case is prove 
enough for me, that we cannot get a correlation for this type of data.

I am however, as always, ready to be proven wrong by you :D
