This code contains the power to process all the rises of the piv campaign. To
use it simply clone the github repository and you will have all the files. In
the end there is a loop. To process all the images simply let the file run as is.

This will likely result in an error. You have to restart the kernel after a few
runs depending on the power of your computer. To be sure restart after every run.

The idea is to run two different settings:
    One with rectangles (Do for ALL images), the window sizes for this are 
        settings.window_height = (256, 128, 64)
        settings.overlap_height = (128, 64, 32)
        settings.window_width = (64, 32, 16)
        settings.overlap_width = (32, 16, 8) 
    One with squares (Do for the 1000 and 1200 Hz runs), the window sizes for this are
        settings.window_height = (128, 64, 32)
        settings.overlap_height = (64, 32, 16)
        settings.window_width = (128, 64, 32)
        settings.overlap_width = (64, 32, 16)

The raw images are stored in a .zip file under the following link
    https://osf.io/q6cw4/
Simply download them and store them in the given data path or change according to your needs.

Currently we are not processing two of the rises:
    - R_h1_f750_p10 - because the displacement is too high
    - R_h1_f1000_1_p14 - because two images have been replaced by dummys which
                         will mess up the ROI prediction
                         
Except for the settings in the loop, no other ones should be changed.
