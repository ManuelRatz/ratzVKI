The 1000 Pa measurement has high frequency noise in the contact angle data, that should not be there from the expectations, so it will only be discussed very briefly
While the Step response and advanced step response even out at some point and have a very similar course, the filtered pressure differs at certain points

There is no second peak for 1500 and 1250 pa in the contact angle when there should be one from the expectations, reason for this unknown
