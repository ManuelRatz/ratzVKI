For the sensitivity of the values see offline notes

Circular vs Linear
Increasing the amount of passes does not have a squared correlation
Linear and Circular don't increase by the same amount the more passes are done
For the most useful one (2 passes) linear is takes about 1.5 times as long
The more iterations are done, the more simliar the calculation times are
